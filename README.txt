Image of mouse neuronal cells is an important tool for studying mice. Examining mouse neuronal cells is an 
essential step in both pharmacological and toxicological tests. The morphology of individual neurons and the 
state of connections between multiple neurons are essential measures of the physiological state of the mouse. 
Staining neuronal cells samples and observation through microscopy is the mainstay of this field. However, this 
step is tedious, monotonous, and requires a high level of practical experience from the researcher. In recent 
years, the analysis of cell morphology using computer vision has proven to be an efficient and accurate solution.
This Project presents a deep neural network-based semantic segmentation model.
